# Ansible Role: Varnish 

Forked role from Geerlingguy Ansible Role Varnish (https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-varnish). 

This role installs Varnish 4.1 from packagecloud.io instead of 5x and configures apt to avoid installing 5x from upstream in dist-upgrade. It also deploys a VCL optimized for WordPress and daily cronjob warmer script written in Bash.
